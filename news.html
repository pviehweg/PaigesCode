 		<h1 class="Intro">Huge Fart Shocks the World!</h1>
 			<p>Not really sure what to write as my first paragraph. For the title, I tried to think of something entertaining... Pretty sure I just seem like a 5 year old now, that thinks farts are funny.</p>
 		<h2>Lame title shocks the class.</h2>
 			<p>Acutally, I bet no one is shocked. If they read this at all, I bet they just question why I would show them this. They would not question the title.</p>
 		<h3>Staring to question my ideas!</h3>
 			<p>At this point, I am not sure my FUNNY title is actually funny. It is more just a sad attempt to keep my attention and make me keep working on this page. Well, since I am still here, looks like it might have worked.  </p>
 		<footer>This is the footer of the page. It is going to show up at the bottom. </footer>
